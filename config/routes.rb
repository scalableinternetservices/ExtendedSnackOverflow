Rails.application.routes.draw do

  devise_for :buyers

  get '/ratings/:order_id', to: 'ratings#new', as: 'new_rating'

  post '/ratings/:order_id', to: 'ratings#create'
  get '/showcart', to: 'cart#showcart'

  # route to get item id info
  get '/items/:id', to: 'items#show'
  post '/cart/:id', to: 'cart#additem'

  get '/profile/seller', to: 'profiles#seller'

This is what I have seen after running 'rails g devise:controllers buyers' and sellers too. Might be useful

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  Ensure you have overridden routes for generated controllers in your routes.rb.
  For example:

    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      devise_for :users, controllers: {
        sessions: 'users/sessions'
      }
    end
=end
