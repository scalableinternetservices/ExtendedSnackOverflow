This is what I have seen after running 'rails g devise:controllers buyers' and sellers too. Might be useful

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  Ensure you have overridden routes for generated controllers in your routes.rb.
  For example:

    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      devise_for :users, controllers: {
        sessions: 'users/sessions'
      }
    end
=end
